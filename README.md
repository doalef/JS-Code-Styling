JS Code Styling
===================

Let's bring some beauty to your messed up project :))

so most javascript developers know about jsint , jscs and eslint
but in case you live in a cave or something here's a summary:

> **JSHINT:**

> - JSHint is a community-driven tool that detects errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.
> - JSHint is open source and it will stay that way according to their website.
> - It's easily adjustable (many people think otherwise tho)
> - You can costumize it for you own enviorment
> - It supports different Versions of EcmaScript such as es5 and es6
